# assignment-ATM

<h2> Requirements </h2>
- At least the following flow should be implemented:
Insert Card => PIN number => Select Account => See Balance/Deposit/Withdraw

- For simplification, there are only 1 dollar bills in this world, no cents. Thus account balance can be represented in integer.

- A bank API wouldn't give the ATM the PIN number, but it can tell you if the PIN number is correct or not.

- Based on your work, another engineer should be able to implement the user interface. You don't need to implement any REST API, RPC, network communication etc, but just functions/classes/methods, etc.

- You can simplify some complex real world problems if you think it's not worth illustrating in the project.
